# simple-staging-env-ex

This repository is an example about how I developed a simple staging
environment at [eKee](https://ekee.io).

The whole process is explained in [this article](https://www.alx-b.com/blog/engineering/startup-staging-env)
published on my website: [alx-b.com](https://alx-b.com).

Feel free to fork it and extend it as you want :)
